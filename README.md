A project to understand different traits and their impact on the survival odds of the passengers on the Titanic. We can use what we learn to create a model, and then apply it to the testing data given by Kaggle. 

*Created by Ethan Bhojani. Data used through the Kaggle Titanic Machine Learning Competition, and coded using python through JupyterLabs.*
